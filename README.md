# GraphicsProject_01

**Standard**: C++11

**Requires**: GLFW / GLEW / GLM and OpenGL driver (should be present with video card)

## Description:

In preparation for my final Computer Graphics project I am developing a structure the project can 
be attached to. Intent is to create a system that can easily have levels designed in a text file
making use of complex meshes and animations. 


The basis of this code has been derived from https://learnopengl.com/, with the addition of my own 
code as I seek to solve problems. The point of this project is to document my assumptions of how a
game engine is created and how the various components interact. Once I've gotten it working and 
I progress in the course I'll begin rewriting as my assumptions are proven incorrect.
